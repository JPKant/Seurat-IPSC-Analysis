# Seurat-IPSC-7_75-Analysis
Using Seurat to Analyze Single Cell Sequencing Data from Mock SARS-CoV-2 Infected human IPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. 

The Covid and Mock Objects were scaled and normalized by SCTransform, and then integrated. Dimensionality Reduction(PCA) and K-Nearest Neighborhood Identification is performed on the integrated object. Clusters are then calculated at an optimal resolution. Expression data is visualized with native Feature and Violin Plots. The Differentially Expressed Mock Gene Markers for all Clusters are calculated from the Normalized RNA data slot. Sample markers are compared with pathway markers from imported heart cell data sets. Medium hCov-19(1: 62%) expressing fibroblast-like and centricular cardiomyocyte clusters selected for further differential expression analysis. Differentially expressed genes between the Covid and Mock groups are calculated for both clusters. Using log2 fold-change, up and down regulated gene lists are inputted into Enrichr to find altered ontological pathways.
